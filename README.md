# Hi, I'm Ramakrishna Bollempelli (@ramakrishna-netizen)

I'm an aspiring Computer Science and Engineering student who enjoys turning ideas into real projects. Over the past few years, I've been exploring **Full-Stack Development**, experimenting with **Machine Learning**, and contributing to Open Source whenever I can.

For me, coding isn't just about solving problems—it's about creating something meaningful, learning along the way, and sharing knowledge with others.
